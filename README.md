## ⭐️ About me
<p>
I'm an Information Systems student at the University of São Paulo - Each and I'm currently part of the Java Full-stack Junior Bootcamp by <a href="https://brazil.generation.org/"> Generation Brasil</a>.  I have been focusing more on the <b> Java language </b> and the <b>Spring framework</b> (backend) in the programming area. However, I also study and have knowledge in the front end - having already worked with <b>Vue.js/</b> and <b>Tailwind CSS.</b>  In addition, I have an affinity with design: Adobe Programs and Figma, UI/Ux concepts and I have <b>advanced English.</b>
