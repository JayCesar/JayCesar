## ⭐️ About me
<p>
I'm an Information Systems student at the University of São Paulo - Each and I'm currently part of the Java Full-stack Junior Bootcamp by Generation Brasil.  I have been focusing more on the Java language and the Spring framework (backend) in the programming area. However, I also study and have knowledge in the front end - having already worked with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS.  In addition, I have an affinity with design: Adobe Programs and Figma, UI/Ux concepts and I have advanced English.

### Beyond programming...

- I love to dance and believe that life without music would not be the same;
- I really like working out: I always feel relief after spending the day sitting in the chair programming.
- I have a strong interest in organization and I am quite into programs that have that goal in mind.
- I really enjoy editing videos and I have a channel where I upload videos from time to time
- I won a scholarship in London, where I improved my English and had unforgettable experiences
- I'm in love with science fiction movies
